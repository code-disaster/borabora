CBOR in itself has 8 so-called major data types. Those data types represent all information stored in a data stream. Complex information, however, can combine elements in a more meaningful way, as well as tag them to give a clearer meaning.

The common data types are:
|===
| Item Type | Data Type | Description | Java Representation

| _0x00_
| UInt
| Unsigned integer which can hold any negative value up to 64 bits.
| `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` based on their given (negative) ranges. Larger values are represented as `java.math.BigInteger`.

| _0x01_
| PInt
| Positive integer which can hold any positive value up to 64 bits.
| `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` based on their given (negative) ranges. Larger values are represented as `java.math.BigInteger`.

| _0x02_
| ByteString
| A string that consists of ASCII characters only and does not need any encoding to be written or read.
| `java.lang.String`

| _0x03_
| TextString
| A string that contains non-ASCII characters and can be encoded in UTF-8. When writing these kinds of strings or reading them from a data stream encoding and decoding takes place.
| `java.lang.String`

| _0x04_
| Sequence or Array
| A container element that contains a stream of an either fixed or indefinite number of further elements.
| `com.noctarius.borabora.Sequence` or `java.util.Iterable<Value>`.

| _0x05_
| Dictionary or Map
| A container element that contains a stream of an either fixed or indefinite number of key-value pairs of elements.
| `com.noctarius.borabora.Dictionary` or `java.util.Iterable<Map.Entry<Value, Value>>`

| _0x06_
| Semantic Tag
| A semantic tag is used as an additional tagging in front of another element. The tag tells the parser that the following item is further specified. A classic example is a DateTime-Tag (TagId: _0_) to tell the parser that the following `ByteString` will represent a date and time element.
| Depends on the semantic tag's id. A meaningful Java 8 representation of the CBOR's data item. That said date and time elements, for example, will return values of the new Java 8 DateTime API but understand Calendar and Date based values.

| _0x07_
| Floating Point or Simple Value
| This data type is more complex, as some content encodes simple values like _null_, _true_ or _false_. On the other hand half, single or double precision float values will be stored. Values can be positive or negative.
| `com.noctarius.borabora.HalfPrecisionFloat`, `float` or `double`, if the value is larger than the representation of those data types, a `java.math.BigDecimal` is used.

|===

Apart from those basic major types, _borabora_ has a number of built-in semantic tags to support a variety of additional data types.
