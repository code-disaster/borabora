_"The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation."_ (http://www.cbor.io)

That said, CBOR is a programming language agnostic data format to serialize information in a very concise byte stream. In comparison to other data formats are available to store JSON-alike data (like BSON, JSONB), CBOR has the main purpose to store and represent those information in one of the smallest possible ways.

In simple words, CBOR can be used or described as a binary representation of JSON. Given this fact, it'll bring in schema-less data handling, it delivers, however, additional advantages on top of that.
